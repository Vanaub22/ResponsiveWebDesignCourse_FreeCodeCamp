## FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course (New)
This repository contains the projects that I developed as a part of my **Responsive Web Design (New) Course** by **FreeCodeCamp**. I have created the projects using **HTML** and **CSS** only. 
This repository will be a great reference for anyone wishing to complete the course on **FreeCodeCamp**.

It has all the **15 Course Projects** that are to be completed as a part of the course as well as the **5 Certification Projects** that have to be completed for obtaining the certificate.

 *My Certification Projects are quite entry-level in terms of design. However, they satisfy all the conditions to be eligible for the certificate.*
